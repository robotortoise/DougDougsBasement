# DougDougsBasement
Codebase for the visual novel "DougDoug's Basement". Originally released at https://robotortoise.itch.io/dougdougsbasement (or DougDougsBasement.org, for the funny) and developed for the Rosa Charity Stream of 2024, this visual novel initially was intended as a short project and ballooned into something that took from August until late November (including marketing).

Anyway, to compile this you'll need a copy of the Naninovel and Text Animator plugins for Unity. The hurricane towards the very end of the game is this one by Hovl Studio. You'll need all three to fully rebuild the project.

Additionally, you MUST unzip the zip file "BGM_MoebiusBattle_Start_WithFieldTheme.zip" and leave the .wav file it extracts in the same directory. It is located at \Assets\Audio\BGM\BorrowedMusic. The full sized .wav file was too large for Github to handle, so I had to use this workaround (also, this is why I had to push so many commits with smaller files - sorry!!)


Source assets are archived at archive.org, along with the demo (and the slightly-altered demo Doug played on stream).

I hope you enjoy! Poggies and all that.

- Jordan, lead writer and co-director.
